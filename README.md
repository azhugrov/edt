Embedded Dart Templates

This library is designed to work with server environment.
Tested for windows platform.
Currently templates should be UTF-8 encoded.

Compiler options:
--out=dir_path - path to an output directory => for example ../test
--file=file_path - path to the template file => for example ../test/example.edt

An example of the syntax could be found in the test folder.
